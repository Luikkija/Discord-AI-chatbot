# Discord-AI-chatbot
Discord bot that takes input from the user and then prints the answer using ChatGPT.
Default prefix is "!" and name is "bot". Default token is 150 so the bot will be able to answer in maximum 150 characters, but you can change it to your liking.

Call the bot by writing "!bot" in front of your discord message. The bot will take a little time to answer depending on the length of the answer.
